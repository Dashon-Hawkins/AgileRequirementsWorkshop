#Establishing a Project Objective

##Guidelines

- An objective should be thorough but to the point
- Should be no more than 25 words
- Should reflect the main requirements of the project
  - Scope
  - Time
  - Etc…
- Should involve participation from as many stakeholders as possible
- The objective should be S.M.A.R.T. for projects that have well defined time-lines and Acceptance guidlines
  - **S.** pecific
  - **M.** easurable
  - **A.** ttainable / Achievable
  - **R.** ealistic
  - **T.** ime-bound
- The project objective should be well documented throughout projects documentation
- Try not to get hung up on defining the perfect objective. There is a high possibility that the objective can morph into something else throughout defining user stories
  - However the objective should be firmly defined and set by the end of defining epics if not sooner

##Purpose

An objective should help define the scope of the project, the timeline and those involved. The Objective should be written in a manner that allows it to be evaluated at the end of the project to assess if it was achieved.

##How to Proceed

- Establish core objectives or goals that the client has for this project
  - Be thorough in the questions you ask. If you feel that you are still missing information try to rephrase the questions or ask them to fill in the blanks with a question like “What do you see as areas that we need to know for this project that we haven’t already covered?”
    - Researching what the company does beforehand will help you facilitate this process as well as help you see “red flags” or areas that should not be in scope
- Determine what the acceptance for the core goals of the project are. How do we measure our success or failures?
  - This could help out story pointing, try to record them

##End Result

After establishing an objective you should be able to jump into the creation of epic (high level) user stories.  A well-defined objective will allow you to check epic user stories against and see how they fit in with the objective as well as having an understanding of time-line and clear acceptance for the project.
