#Agile Requirements Workshop Preparation

This is a guide for what to expect, who to bring, and how to prepare for the agile requirements process.

##Meeting Objective

Representatives from everyone with a stake in seeing this project succeed including end users, business experts, managers, and developers will meet for a four-hour structured brainstorming meeting to participate in defining the vision for the solution, brainstorming a list of as many features from differing points of view as time allows, ranking features in terms of importance, and defining the set of those core features that are both most important and absolutely necessary for a solid usable first release – the minimum viable product.

##Meeting Agenda – Four Hour Meeting

An average requirements meeting is four hours, typically done in one block of time. It can be scaled up for more complex projects, but generally no more than three consecutive days of four hour meetings.

1.	General Introductions, Meeting Agenda, and Guidelines - 10m
1.	Define the Objective of the Solution - 20m
1.	List the User Roles - 20m
1.	Brainstorm Features - 150m
1.	Prioritize Features - 20m
1.	Identify the Core Feature Set - 20m

##Who Should Attend

It is vital that representatives from anyone who has an interest in the success of the project attend the meeting. 

- **Project Sponsor** – The project’s official champion who can clear organizational hurdles and be a vocal proponent for the project.
- **Product Owner** – The product expert who will be in touch with the project on a daily basis and will help find the answers the team needs to clear roadblocks.
- **Domain Expert** – Someone with the expertise in the problem area; this may also be the Product Owner or it may be one or two other people.
- **End User** – Representatives from anyone who will use the software including entering data, administering and maintaining, viewing outputs and reports, and making decisions based on the use or data.

There will also be representatives from the development team including:

- **Facilitator** – The meeting leader who will help keep the meeting on track and make sure everyone’s time is respected.
- **Scribe** – The note taker, picture taker, and person who will make sure the meeting sticks to the allotted time.
- **Developer** – One or two coders who will potentially be involved in building the solution.

##How to Prepare For the Meeting

*Plan…*

•	Decide on which representatives you should bring, shoot for between 3 and 10.
•	Discuss the project with your colleagues and the team you are brining. Take notes of any pain points they have, what their top priorities are, and what their expectations are.

*Bring…*

•	If there are software solution examples of what you are looking for, bring a list of links or screen shots.
•	If your process is complicated, bring flowcharts and diagrams to help illustrate.

##Some Ground Rules

We want to respect everyone’s time and use it most efficiently, and we’d like to set the tone for what to expect in a group brainstorming meeting:

- Please no cell phones, tablets, or laptops because we need everyone to fully engage with the group during the meeting and contribute everything they can. If you do get an urgent call, please leave the room to take it. You can bring in a laptop to show the group something on the computer, but afterwards it needs to be closed.
- The meeting’s process involves thinking of as many ideas as we can. It’s important to let everyone have a say and to let bad ideas come out without judgment – if they are truly bad they’ll fall off the list in the end. In essence:
  - Show mutual respect for each other
  - Actively participate
  - Stay on task
  - List to others and let them finish
  - Feel free to speak your mind

##Meeting Results and Deliverables

There’s still a lot of work to do after the meeting to coalesce the notes and do some additional research. Within a matter of two-to-three weeks we will meet again to deliver the results, including:

1.	A plan for your project that describes everything we captured during the meeting. It’s the roadmap and shared vision for your project that you own and are free to do with as you see fit.
1.	Any mockups or preliminary design that are generated during the meeting or afterwards.
1.	Pictures of the sketches, flowcharts, and diagrams from the meeting.
1.	A budgetary and schedule estimate for the minimum viable product.
1.	All of this documentation will be provided in electronic format and you will own all rights to it.
