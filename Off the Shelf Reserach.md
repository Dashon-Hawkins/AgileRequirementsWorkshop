#Off-the-Shelf Research

##Research Results
After each workshop meeting the Development team will research any existing commercial off-the-shelf solutions that could be incorporated to save time. 

If the solution is commercial and may have competitors, some research may be done to identify those competitors.

For web solutions, the team may research domain names and hosting options.

Even if nothing is found, this document is used to record what research was done.
